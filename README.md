# TigTag

TigTag is an interpreter for the Tag esoteric language, written in Haskell. For more information about the Tag language, have a look at [the esolangs.org website](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Tag)

TigTag is currently in development and does not have a functioning interface, however TagEval.hs contains methods that can be loaded into GHCi to run Tag programs.
